# HR-Analysis-PostgreSQL-
In this HR task, we are utilizing SQL to perform a series of data management and analysis tasks involving employee information. The goal is to work with a database that stores detailed records of employees, such as their job positions, salaries, departments, and start dates, while executing queries to derive valuable insights.

The task involves multiple steps:

Data Manipulation: Creating and updating employee and department tables to ensure data accuracy, including promotions, salary adjustments, and tracking employees who have left the company.

Data Analysis: Using SQL queries to retrieve meaningful insights, such as identifying top earners in each department, analyzing average salaries, calculating running totals of salaries over time, and determining salary ranks within divisions.

Advanced SQL Techniques: Applying window functions (like RANK() and ROW_NUMBER()), common table expressions (CTEs), and aggregate functions to organize and manipulate data at various levels of detail, reflecting real-world HR management scenarios.

The queries focus on providing the HR department with the ability to manage employee data, monitor salary developments, and produce reports that help in decision-making processes related to promotions, compensation, and workforce organization.
